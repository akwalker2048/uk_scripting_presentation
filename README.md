# uk_scripting_presentation
This is a quick presentation that I put together to help a lab group at UK get a brief introduction to BASH scripting.

# Dependencies
This repo was tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine that had a pretty complete LaTeX installation.  You should have most of what you need if you have installed `texlive-latex-extra`.  You might need to install the `latex-beamer` package to be able to create the presentation.

# Creating the Presentation
Assuming everything is in a good state you should be able to create the most recent presentation pdf by doing:
```git fetch --all
git pull
make clean; clear; make```
